### **Basic Git Concepts**

1.  **Repository (Repo)**
    A project folder that Git is tracking. Can be **local** (on your computer) or **remote** (Like GitHub)
2.  **Version Control**
    A system that tracks changes to code over time, letting you revert to previous versions or collaborate with others.
3.  **Commit**
    A snapshot of your changes. Includes a message describing what changed.
4.  **Working Directory**
    The current state of your files on disk.
5.  **Staging Area**
    Where you prepare changes before committing. You "stage" files that are ready to be committed.

### **Common Commands**

6.  `git init`
    Initializes a new Git repository in a folder.
7.  `git status`
    Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.
8.  `git add <file>`
    Stages changes in a file for the next commit.
9.  `git commit -m "message"`
    Saves the staged changes with a commit message
10. `git push`
    Sends local commits to the remote repository.
    **Note**: You may need to first create a repo in github, and use `add origin` to link your local repo to the remote one.
11. `git pull`
    Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to your local one.
12. `git fetch`
    Downloads changes from the remote, but doesn't merge them automatically.
13. `git clone <repo>`
    Copies a remote repository to your local machine
